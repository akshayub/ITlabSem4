1. Implement Bubble/Selection and Insertion Sort algorithm.

a. Input: N = 100, 1000, 10000 for unsorted, sorted and random numbers,

where N is the size of the input.

b. Analyze and compare the algorithms for the above cases considering the

number of iterations in a loop. Write a conclusion with asymptotic notations.

2. Implement divide and conquer technique for sorting the numbers using Merge and

Quick Sort.

a. Input: consider worst, average and best cases of Input.

b. Analyze the algorithms by Substitution, Recurrence tree method.

3. Implement and demonstrate why implementation of Fibonacci series using

recursion takes O (2 ^n ). Find the alternative solution to reduce the complexity of the

same.

Write the solutions to the above problems in observation book and get signed by TA and course

instructor.

Dates:

1. Last date for Execution: 9 th January 2017.

2. Sign by Course Instructor: 12 th January 2017.
